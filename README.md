# OpenAI Chatbot

### Description
This project aims to facilitate my self-directed coding education by leveraging the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. While the web-based ChatGPT has been incredibly helpful, it comes with a limitation of 50 prompts per 3-hour window. To overcome this constraint, this chatbot uses OpenAI's API, offering a more cost-effective and unrestricted learning experience.

### Setup
1. **Anaconda**: This project utilizes Anaconda to manage dependencies and create isolated environments. You can download Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#download-section).
2. **Environment**: The project runs in a conda environment named `gpt4env`.
    - To create a new environment, run: `conda create --name gpt4env python=3.11.4`
    - To activate the environment, run: `conda activate gpt4env`

### Usage
Initially, the OpenAI API's chat feature wasn't designed to offer a conversational experience; instead, it focused on script-based interaction. This project aims to provide a more user-friendly, web-like experience by emulating the features of ChatGPT.

### Progress
While this chatbot isn't as comprehensive as the web-based ChatGPT, it serves as a minimum viable product (MVP) for basic interactions. 

### Next Steps
The current version includes a rudimentary GUI built using the Tkinter library. There's still room for improvement, particularly in UI/UX aspects.

### Issues
- The initial window dimensions for the GUI are too narrow and need to be adjusted.
